# napalm
A collection of napalm scripts to help automate network tasks.

### napalm-single-node-change.py
A simple napalm script that allows you to have a separate text file (changes.txt) that lists your changes and applies it to a single host (via a prompt). Useful when you need a non-technical type to make changes for you, or to give to a junior engineer to make consistent changes.
